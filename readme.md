# Remove [Oh my ZSH](https://ohmyz.sh/) from [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) based distros

## Remove all dependencies and remaining files from Oh my ZSH

<br />
<br />

To `run` use:

```bash
chmod +x remove-oh-my-zsh.py
sudo ./remove-oh-my-zsh.py

or 

sudo python3 remove-oh-my-zsh.py

```

`SUDO` is needed, without superuser access we can't remove some files and Oh my ZSH configs
